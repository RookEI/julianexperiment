# Purpose

This code is just experimentation. My goal here is to understand Julian Date and Modified Julian Date and construct both representations through code.

The '*.txt' files are data downloaded from Stable32 website for Frequency Stability Analysis. The data has no actual purpose here other than to look pretty!
