# Purpose

This code is just experimentation. My goal here is to understand Julian Date and Modified Julian Date and construct both time formats.

The '*.txt' files located within the `/data` directory is from the Stable32 website for Frequency Stability Analysis. The data has no actual purpose here other than to look pretty!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RookEI/julianexperiment.git

Then install all required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file into a virtual environment

```bash

# or with pip
